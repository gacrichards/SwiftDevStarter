# SwiftDevStarter
A step-by-step, commit-by-commit example of installation, integration, and usage of the ROXIMITY SDK.

This project runs the iOS ROXIMITY V2 SDK in a Swift project with a minimal UI to display ROXIMITY SDK event histories. The event histories displayed are all accessible through V2's Devicehook delegate interface and are intended provide transparency to the ongoings of the SDK.
